I'm a Ph.D candidate at [Machine Learning and Intelligence (MLI) lab](https://mli.kaist.ac.kr/) in KAIST, advised by [Prof.Eunho Yang](https://sites.google.com/site/yangeh/publications).

My research interest mainly targets proposing algorithms **facilitating deep learning models to properly learn under stressed conditions** (*e.g.* limited supervision), which is critical in deploying Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems to real-world applications. I currently focus on the following research areas:
- Graph neural network algorithm
- Data Augmentation
- Learning with class-imbalanced data
- Self-supervised representation learning
